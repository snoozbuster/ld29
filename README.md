@_snoozbuster and @jon_fisch's entry for LD29. Also @_snoozbuster's roommate, who isn't on Twitter.

Notes about source
==================

The solution file is for Visual Studio 2012, which doesn't natively support the XNA Game Studio plugin. This SO question (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10881005/how-to-install-xna-game-studio-on-visual-studio-2012) should help with any issues tweaking VS2012 or VS2013 to work correctly; I've performed the steps myself quite successfully. Although the source itself doesn't have any particular license associated with it, I'd appreciate it if you credited me (Alex Van Liew, @_snoozbuster) for any source you use, and I'm sure Jonathan Fischer (@jon_fisch) would appreciate credit for any 2D/3D assets you use. The opening animation is courtesy of my roommate, Troy Brasel, and of course, Jonathan and I would love to hear about anything you make using our stuff as a base. I posted the code here so that people can learn from what I've done, as I've learned from others.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't use this idea directly, without getting permission from me first, though. I'd like to turn it into some sort of full game someday, and I can't do that if someone else does it first! Thanks, and happy coding!
